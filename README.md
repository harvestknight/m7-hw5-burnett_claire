Issues I had while completing this assignment:
-My console showing element name instead of tag name. I realized I was accidentally consoling it as a string instead of variable.
-Brackets was running a bunch of unusual errors - I had to disable ESLint, then it was fine. 
-I struggled to figure out which order to append items to each other and whether to call items by their variable name or tag name. It took me a while to get through steps #16-19.
